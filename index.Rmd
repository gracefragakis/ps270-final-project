## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to fashion, or environmental issues. I would consider combining the two and finding data related to environmental damages in different countries due to fashion trends or consumerism. 

I am also interested in exploring data related to the amount of soda consumed in each state of the United states, specifically Diet Dr. Pepper. 

Furthermore, I am also interested in exploring data related to the size of celebrities carbon footprint compared to the average human in the US.
